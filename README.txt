This program works by editing config.ini, then running main.py. The result will be in Results.txt

You need to have python installed, no external libraries should be necessairy.

If you just want to use the seedfinder, you should not have to edit any files besides config.ini.

the /dev folder is only usefull if you want to add new generators to the program.

On my pc looking at all 1000000 seeds takes about 5 seconds. 

If you find a bug tag me on discord @cirion02

(Feel free to ignore the terminal output of the program, it's only to keep tracks of the speed of program, the usefull output will be in the result file.)
