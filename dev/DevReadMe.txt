These files are made with my settings in visual studio code in mind. If they don't work for you try moving them into the main directory.

If you want to do a different gen, make sure it's srl v5. then put it in GenerateBoardsFile.js and BingoGenToJson.js, then run those files (Doing this requires node.js)
make sure to change the filenames to something new, then run GenerateTextFileFromGenJson.py with the new filename
